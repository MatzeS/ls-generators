Command-line tool suite for laser cutting based on LaserScript

LaserScript generators is a small command line tool suite to generate basic laser cutting shapes/paths.

## Installation
These commands are build with TypeScript using the node runtime and command-line modules available for this platform.
```bash
  npm install;
  npm run-script build;
```

## Usage
# grid
```bash
  npm run-script grid
```

This command generates a grid of triangles each cut at different power/speed settings.
